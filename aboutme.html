            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I enjoy reading fiction books because they allow me to escape from reality and not have to think about what I'm stressing about right now. Watching shows and movies is the same. I also like going out with my friends to do anything like bowling or ice skating. After school, I do kendo. Kendo is a Japanese martial art and has trained me in my reflexes and posture as well as the way I hold myself. I used to do swimming as well as gymnastics for several years. I have also played netball for a little while before.</p>

         <h2>Strengths and Achievements</h2>
            <p>A strength that I have is being able to communicate with others. This, in turn, helps me to work in a team and communicate with them about what we need to do and how we're going to do it. I was on my school cafe team in intermediate where we had to cook and provide food as well as serve them to people who had booked tables. I was able to both cook with others and talk about what we each needed to do. I was also able to serve and be polite to customers which I think is part of my ability to always have a calm demanour and not be rude to anybody. I get along with people very well and can usually tell what offends them because I stay silent a lot of the time. This gives me the opportunity to observe behaviours and know how to talk to someone.  </p>
