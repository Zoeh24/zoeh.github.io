            <h2>My Culture</h2>
            <p>I have a mix of both Taiwanese culture and New Zealand culture. In Taiwanese culture, we enjoy eating many <br> foods and having festivals. Some popular Taiwanese foods include gua bao, sticky rice, and Taiwanese fried chicken. We <br> also have foods that are specifically eaten on holidays. For example, on Lunar New Year we eat turnip/radish cakes. These <br> are a personal favourite of mine and we eat it becuase in chinese, cake means "tall" and radish is a homophone for <br> "good fortune". While we do eat it on Lunar New Year especially, it's still a very popular dish among Taiwanese people all throughout the year. </p>
